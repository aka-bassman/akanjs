# create-akan-workspace

[한국어](https://github.com/akan-team/akanjs/blob/main/pkgs/create-akan-workspace/README.ko.md) | [Docs](https://akanjs.com/docs/intro/quickstart) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-akan-workspace)

Create a new [Akan.js](https://akanjs.com) workspace with one command.

```bash
bunx create-akan-workspace@latest
```

It installs the `akan` CLI (`@akanjs/cli`, at this package's own version) globally, then runs
`akan create-workspace`, which:

1. asks for a workspace name and an app name, unless you passed them,
2. creates `./<workspace>` and installs its dependencies,
3. generates the first app with a sample `task` module and pages,
4. writes `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and Cursor rules, and registers the Akan MCP server for Claude Code, Codex and
   Cursor,
5. makes the first git commit.

Then start the app. It opens on `http://localhost:8282`.

```bash
cd <workspace>
akan start <app> --open
```

## With Your Coding Agent

Pass both names and nothing is asked, so a coding agent can run it on its own:

```bash
bunx create-akan-workspace@latest my-company --app web
```

The [quick start](https://akanjs.com/docs/intro/quickstart) has a prompt to paste into Claude Code or Codex that
checks Bun, runs this, and starts the app. Reopen the agent inside the new workspace afterwards: its MCP server and
rules load from there.
