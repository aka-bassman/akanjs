# throw → Err

Domain code throws `new Err("<module>.error.<key>")` and registers the key as `[en, ko]` in that module's
dictionary `.error({})`. `throw new Error(...)` fails the build (`no-throw-raw-error.grit`).

## Getting the import side right

This is the common failure. Import `Err` from the source matching the **runtime side of the file**:

- server code: `import { Err } from "../dict"`
- UI: `from "@libs/<lib>/client"` or `from "@apps/<app>/client"`

## Where the rule does not apply

The lint rule exempts tests, `*.constant.ts`, `common/**`, and `env/**`. The last two have **no legal `Err`
import path at all**, so keep throwing code out of them entirely rather than reaching for a workaround.

## Where each error belongs

- a state-machine precondition → `document.ts`
- a cross-document rule → `service.ts`
- request-level policy → a guard in `signal.ts`

Best-effort code returns a sentinel (`null`, `undefined`, `{}`) instead of throwing. `try/catch` is rare and
always converts an exception into a decision: a guard catches, warns, and returns `false`; an adapter
catches, logs, and returns `null`. A store action never catches — let the framework toast the `Err`.
Client-side validation failure is `msg.error("<key>")` plus an early return, never a throw.

**A failure another process reported travels as itself.** A server-to-server `fetch.<endpoint>(…, { origin })`
restores the remote `Err` with its class, key and data. Rethrow it as-is — wrapping it in a `new Error`
discards what the endpoint chose to say, and a bare `Error` is generalized to "Internal Server Error" on the
way out.

Korean `.error()` messages end in `다.`.
