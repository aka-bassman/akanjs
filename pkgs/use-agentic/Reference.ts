 * screen was already holding — a document with an array of rows in it is tens of kilobytes — and unlike a tool
 * result, which answers one turn's question, a reference is part of a *user* message: it rides the wire on this
 * turn and on every turn after it, and it is the last thing compaction folds, because folding the thing the user
 * pointed at is folding the question.
 *
 * So the value is bounded where it is staged, before it ever enters a message. Clipped rather than dropped, and
 * the note says which: a model shown a value it cannot see the end of asks a narrower question, where one shown
 * nothing answers from the field names.
