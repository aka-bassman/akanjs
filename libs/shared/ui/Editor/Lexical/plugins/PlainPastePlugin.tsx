 * Keeps the words and drops the markup when pasting into a field that has no rich capability at all.
 *
 * Lexical's rich-text paste reads `text/html`, so copying off a web page into what the person sees as a
 * textarea drops in headings, tables and colours the field offers no control for — content its own
 * markdown cannot round-trip, and which the agent's whole-field write would then refuse to overwrite.
 * Registered above `RichTextPlugin`'s handler, and mounted only where `isPlainOnly` holds.
